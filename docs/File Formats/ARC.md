## **Introduction**

ARC, short for "archive," is a file extension and format used to bundle multiple files or data sets into a single file. While the concept of archive files isn't unique to any one platform or developer, the ARC format has been notably used in various video games across different platforms, including games developed by Nintendo.

## **Structure and Components**:

1. **Files and Directories**: An ARC file typically contains a structured directory of files. These can range from game assets like textures, sound files, and models to scripts, configuration files, and more.
2. **Headers**: ARC files usually have a header section that provides metadata about the contents, such as the number of files, their names, offsets, and sizes. This makes it easier for the game engine to locate and extract specific assets.
3. **Compression**: Depending on the implementation, ARC files may use various compression algorithms to reduce the size of the bundled data. Compression not only saves disk space but can also improve loading times in games.
