## **Introduction**:

BCFNT stands for "Binary CTR Font." It's a proprietary font format developed by Nintendo, primarily for the Nintendo 3DS system ("CTR" being the internal codename for the 3DS). This format is used to store and display font data, including character glyphs, metrics, and other related font properties.

## **Structure and Components**:

### **Glyph Data**:

The primary content of BCFNT files is the actual glyph data for each character in the font. These glyphs represent the visual shapes of each character and ensure that they are displayed correctly in games or software.

### **Character Metrics**:

This includes information such as width, height, rise, fall, and other metrics associated with each character. This data ensures that characters are rendered with proper spacing and alignment.

### **Character Map**:

BCFNT files typically have a map that links each character's Unicode value to its corresponding glyph data, allowing the game or software to display text strings correctly.

### **Texture Data**:

BCFNT often uses texture-based fonts, where each character is represented as a textured quad. The BCFNT file will contain the texture data used to render each character.

### **Headers**:

Like many file formats, BCFNT files have a header section that provides metadata about the font, such as its version, number of characters, and other properties.
