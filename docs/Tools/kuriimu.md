[Kuriimu](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu) is a versatile software toolset designed primarily for manipulating and translating game file formats. It is widely used in fan translation projects and by modders to edit the content of game files to ensure compatibility and functionality with the original game engines.

We will focus on the image editing aspect of Kukkii:

Kukkii is a component within the [Kuriimu](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu) toolset dedicated to image manipulation. It's tailored to work with game textures and graphic resources, allowing users to view, extract and modify these assets. Some of its notable features regarding specific file formats include

[[BCRES]] files: Kukkii's ability to display mipmaps of [[BCRES]] files means that users can view multiple resolution versions of the same texture. Mipmaps are used in 3D rendering to optimize performance and reduce graphical artifacts by using lower resolution textures when an object is farther away from the camera.

[[ARC]] files: [[ARC]] is a common archive format used in various games to bundle multiple files together. In the context of games, these archives can often contain icons or small textures that represent game elements or user interface components. Kukkii allows users to easily view and extract these icons from [[ARC]] files, simplifying the process of extracting and modifying assets.

For those working on game translations or mods, Kukkii provides a user-friendly interface to interact with game images without having to delve into the technical details of each format. However, as with any tool that manipulates game files, users should proceed with caution to avoid unintentional corruption or incompatibility issues.
